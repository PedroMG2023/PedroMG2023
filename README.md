<h1 align="center"><b>Hi , I'm Pedro Miranda </b><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35"></h1>

I am a second-year computer engineering student at the National University of Engineering (UNI), 
I am passionate about developing web and desktop software, and perhaps very soon video games.

I took a CS50 course and I am currently still learning more technologies from the 
CS50 course - programming with python and javascript

I also like to continue learning and improving with each opportunity, especially when 
I work as a team for events such as hackathons and rallies, 
and any other opportunity I have, it is a pleasure to be able to help.
